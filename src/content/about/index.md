As a child, I remember being fascinated by the world of internet, playing geeky challenges, and creating simple games in Macromedia Flash MX. I later pursued bachelor's in Computer Science from [NITK](https://www.nitk.ac.in/) to learn how this wonderful machine works.

I am passionate for real world problems and am sure technology can solve most of them. I yearn to make a positive impact on humanity in my lifetime.

I am a supporter of [free and open internet](https://www.eff.org/issues/net-neutrality) and have recently started my contributions in open-source.

When I'm not in front of my computer, I'm probably in [The Himalayas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Himalayas), cruising around on my motorbike, or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
